# Smart Survival (Fabric)

Smart Survival is a Fabric mod that adds realistic survival mechanics to Minecraft by extending the way players manage food, temperature, sleep and conditions.

The mod aims to make survival immersive without making it any more complex.

## Features

### Advanced Nutrition System

Smart Survival introduces a **food system** where food is organized into food groups.

- A pattern of eating the same type of food repeatedly loses its effectiveness.
- Promotes and rewards a _healthy diet._
- Tracks food groups _per player_.
- Nutrition data is exchanged between server and client.
- Contains **custom nutrition UI in game.**

### Temperature & Environment Effects

Neither the environment nor the actions of the player contribute to player temperature.

- Server-side temperature logic is run for consistency.
- Standing near campfires causes increased body heat.
- Extreme temperatures increase the risk of a coldness penalty.
- Sustaining too long near campfires raises the risk of being in danger.
- Extreme temperatures create survival penalties.

### Improved Sleep Mechanics
